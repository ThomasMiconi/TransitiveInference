### Additional code

This additional programs mentioned in the Appendix of the paper:

1- `toymodel.py` contains the toy model version of the neural algorithm.
2- `TI_FrozenWin.py` contains a version of the main program with frozen, non-trainable input weights. It behaves much like `main.ipynb` in the main folder (which it is based on).
